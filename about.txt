Lumiere is a Junior Achievement Company run by hard-working and committed students.
Our mission statement, “Let us light up the future” speaks to what we hope to achieve as a company, a brighter future for everyone. One of our main goals is to be environmentally responsible, and we have achieved this through our very first product, Soibeam. Soibeam is a soy based candle, in a reusable mason jar. We as a company strive to foster an environment filled with honesty respect, and social responsibility.
