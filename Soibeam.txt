Soibeam is a hand made, scented candle made from soy wax. Unlike paraffin candles, soy wax candles are biodegradable, and do not increase CO2 levels in the atmosphere like paraffin candles do. Additionally, Soibeam is scented with essential oils instead of chemical fragrances, and lasts up to twice as long. It contains no carcinogens, and produces little black soot when burned, for cleaner and healthier use.
